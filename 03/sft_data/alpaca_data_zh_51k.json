    "input": "",
    "output": "Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a collection of connected nodes to approximate functions that can map input variables to outputs. To learn the parameters of a neural network, the computer needs to adjust the weights of the connections between nodes so that the network produces the correct output for given inputs. This adjustment process, known as learning, involves comparing the output produced by the network with the desired outcome and then using optimization algorithms to adjust the weights so that the network output approximates the desired outcome. This process is repeated over multiple iterations for multiple inputs and desired outputs. Eventually, the weights between the connected nodes are adjusted so that the output of the neural network matches the desired outcomes, completing the learning process."

    "output": "A popular example of a machine learning algorithm is the Support Vector Machine (SVM). It is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It plots data points in an n-dimensional space, separated by a decision boundary or hyperplane. The algorithm uses the maximum margin, which are margins that are as far away as possible from the two classes of data points. These margins help create the optimal decision hyperplane. The algorithm then adjusts the decision hyperplane by considering the errors that occur in the classification task and modifies the hyperplane accordingly.\n\nUltimately, the Support Vector Machine can perform the classification task using the optimal decision hyperplane, predicting the category of data points."

Then, using this data, it creates personalized profiles for users based on their past behavior. By analyzing other items purchased or viewed by similar users, the system can recommend tailor-made items to suit the user's profile and interests."
